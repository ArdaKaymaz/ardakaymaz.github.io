title: "Factors Affecting Survivability in Japanese Quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica)"
excerpt: "This study investigated the effects of feather color, incubation length, hatch weight, parasite infestation, and genetic factors on the survivability of quails up to 42 days of age.<br>Feather Color: The survival probability of white quails was found to be 56% lower compared to other colors.<br>Incubation Length: Quails hatched after 17 days of incubation had a higher survival rate than those hatched after 18 days or more.<br>Hatch Weight: A 1-gram increase in hatch weight increased the probability of survival by 21%.<br>Parasite Infestation: Quails exposed to poultry red mites had a 2.63 times higher risk of death. The risk of death increased by 11% per 1,000 mites.<br>Genetic Effects: Survivability is influenced by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Heritability estimates indicate a low to moderate genetic effect.<br>In conclusion, quail survival is determined by multiple environmental and genetic factors, with feather color, hatch weight, incubation length, and parasite infestation playing significant roles."

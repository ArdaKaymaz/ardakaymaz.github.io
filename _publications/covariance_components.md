title: "Estimation of (Co)Variance Components for Viability, Incubation Length and Hatch Weight in Japanese Quail"
excerpt: "This study aimed to estimate the genetic parameters of survival, incubation length, and hatching weight in quails. Data from 2,280 quails were analyzed using the AI-REML method.<br>Direct and maternal heritabilities for survival: 0.18 and 0.59, but after adjustments, they were estimated as 0.03-0.02 and 0.08-0.05.<br>Direct and maternal heritabilities for incubation length: 0.16 and 0.71, with adjusted values of 0.03-0.06 and 0.14-0.26.<br>Direct and maternal heritabilities for hatching weight: 0.55 and 0.13.<br>
Genetic correlations:
- Survival and incubation length: -0.68<br>
- Survival and hatching weight: 0.52<br>
- Incubation length and hatching weight: -0.30<br>
In conclusion, the genetic variation in survival was found to be low, indicating that environmental factors play a significant role."

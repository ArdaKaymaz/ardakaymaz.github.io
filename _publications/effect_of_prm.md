title: "The Effect of Poultry Red Mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) Infestation on the Viability of Japanese Quail"
excerpt: "This study investigated the effect of poultry red mite (D. gallinae) infestation on the viability of quails. The experiment was conducted using 800 Japanese quails and repeated four times. Half of the quails were in the control group, while the other half were exposed to mite infestation.<br>
Findings:<br>
- Infestation significantly shortened the lifespan of quails.<br>
- The mortality risk of infested quails was 2.63 times higher than that of non-infested quails.<br>
- <br>During the first 26 days, mites caused a high mortality rate, but after day 26, despite an increase in mite density per individual, their lethal effect diminished.<br>
Overall, poultry red mites were found to have a negative impact on the viability of sexually immature quails."

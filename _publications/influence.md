title: "Plumage color, hatching day and hatching weight influence the survivability up to sexual maturity in japanese quails"
excerpt: "This study examined the effects of plumage color, hatching day, and hatching weight on the survivability of quails. A population of 2,280 birds was monitored from hatching to 6 weeks of age, and mortality records were analyzed using a threshold model.<br>
Findings:<br>

Overall survivability rate from hatching to 42 days was 93.4%.<br>

Survivability rates by plumage color:<br>

- Wild-type: 92.8%<br>

- Yellow: 94.3%<br>

- Brown: 94.87%<br>

- White: 86.99% (significantly lower than others, P<0.05).<br>

- Birds hatching on the 17th day had a 56% higher survival probability compared to those hatching after 17 days (P=0.07).

- A 1-gram increase in hatching weight increased survival probability by 23% (P=0.03).<br>

Conclusion:
Plumage color, hatching day, and hatching weight significantly influence quail survivability. White quails had the lowest survivability, while earlier hatching and higher hatching weight improved survival rates. These factors should be carefully analyzed to understand their impact on survivability."

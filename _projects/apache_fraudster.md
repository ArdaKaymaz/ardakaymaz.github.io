title: "Apache vs The Fraudster"
excerpt: "Hadoop file distribution system was set up on the Linux operating system, datasets were organized using Hive, and logistic regression and random forest models were trained using different versions of the Spark library. Significant differences in model performance were observed between different Spark versions. Ultimately, a successful fraud detection model was developed using the Random Forest algorithm, achieving 78.8% recall and 90.0% precision."

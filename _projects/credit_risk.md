title: "Bank Credit Risk Prediction"
excerpt: "A successful customer risk assessment method was developed. The customer dataset was enriched and prepared for model optimization by applying data cleaning, data structuring, and feature engineering. Using the processed dataset and a deep learning algorithm, a credit risk prediction model was trained, achieving a recall of 99.5% and an F1 score of 62.5%."

title: "Cat-Dog Classifier App"
excerpt: "Different models were developed by applying fine-tuning to the pre-trained VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet50 models. The models were tracked using MLflow based on model performance, model size, different epoch counts, and training time. Ultimately, the VGG16 model was preferred with an accuracy of 97.14%. Rapid prototyping was performed using Streamlit with the developed model."

title: "Digit Recognition with AI"
excerpt: "This project developed a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images of 0-9). The model architecture includes:
- A Flatten layer to convert 28x28 pixels into a 1D input.
- A hidden Dense layer (128 units, ReLU activation).
- An output layer (10 units, softmax activation for class probabilities).

Trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, the model achieved 97.7% test accuracy, 98.0% precision, and 97.6% recall, demonstrating strong performance despite its simplicity. The results validate ANNs as effective tools for basic image recognition tasks."

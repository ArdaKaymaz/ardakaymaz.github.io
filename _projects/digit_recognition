title: "Digit Recognition with AI"
excerpt: "This project developed a basic Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset (28x28 grayscale images of 0-9). Trained with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, the model achieved 97.7% test accuracy, 98.0% precision, and 97.6% recall, demonstrating strong performance despite its simplicity. The results validate ANNs as effective tools for basic image recognition tasks."

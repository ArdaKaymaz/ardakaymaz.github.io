title: "Concrete Work!"
excerpt: "This study analyzed four neural network models (A-D) to assess the impact of data scaling, model depth, and training epochs on accuracy and efficiency.  
<p>Key findings: Scaling enhances performance and consistency, deeper architectures reduce training duration and variability, while more epochs improve accuracy at a computational cost. The results emphasize balancing architectural complexity, normalization, and resource allocation for efficient model optimization."

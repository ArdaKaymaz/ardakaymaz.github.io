title: "Experimental Study"
excerpt: "This study resulted as scaling enhances performance and consistency, deeper architectures reduce training duration and variability, while more epochs improve accuracy at a computational cost. The results emphasize balancing architectural complexity, normalization, and resource allocation for efficient model optimization."

<div class="about-content">
  <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">
    I am a Data Science Consultant and a strategic business partner dedicated to solving complex problems and empowering clients through data-driven solutions. As a Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience in data analytics, statistical learning, and time-series analysis—complemented by extensive expertise in artificial intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, and big data technologies—I bridge the gap between theoretical science and industrial application. With a strong background in quantitative genetics and applied sciences, I have successfully completed over 15 data science projects and published 4 scientific papers, providing high-impact AI solutions specifically tailored for the E-commerce, Retail, and Manufacturing sectors.
